  What if we can have heaven on earth? My art is an exploration of this seeming
  impossibility. The person I am and become while I paint is the source of it. A
  source normally buried by debris but always pulsing. Art is an exercise of
  being exposed. Heaven on earth is a concept that is hard to acknowledge. Art
  is the permission.

**What if we can have heaven on earth?** My art is an exploration of this seeming impossibility. The person I am and become while I paint is the source of it. A source normally buried by debris but always pulsing. Art is an exercise of being exposed. Heaven on earth is a concept that is hard to acknowledge. Art is the permission.
