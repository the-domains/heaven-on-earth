  What if we can have heaven on earth? My art is an exploration of this seeming
  impossibility. The person I am and become while I paint is the source of it. A
  source normally buried by debris but always pulsing. Art is an exercise of
  being exposed. Heaven on earth is a concept that is hard to acknowledge. Art
  is the permission.

  Teaching is a facilitation of that magic. Magic is born when personal

  expression is the vehicle but witnessing magic is my fuel.

## **What if we can have heaven on earth?** My art is an exploration of this seeming impossibility. The person I am and become while I paint is the source of it. A source normally buried by debris but always pulsing. Art is an exercise of being exposed. Heaven on earth is a concept that is hard to acknowledge. Art is the permission.

## Why I teach.

There's magic in seeing someone capitalize on their own creative power. Teaching is a facilitation of that magic. Magic is born when personal signatures are imprinted to ideas. Facilitation of its discovery and expression is the vehicle but witnessing magic is my fuel.
